# Practice

## Reminder

1. Do not use the mouse while doing the exercises.
2. Try to follow the Neovim Philosophy to solve the problems.

## Exercises

We have a text file named `text`:

1. Postpone the 3 dates in **practice1** by 3 days.
2. Append the current line number to the end of each line in **practice2**.
3. Add spaces before and after each plus sign in **practice3**.
4. Add parentheses around every **thisisalongword** in **practice4**, like this: `(thisisalongword)`.
5. Add parentheses around each word in **practice5**.
6. Correct the last 4 words of the 5th line in **practice6**.

## Thinking Exercise

If you try to follow the Neovim Philosophy to solve the above exercises, you'll notice that for some exercises, even the powerful dot command can't fully achieve ideal repetition. Is there any way to optimize the approach?
